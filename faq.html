      <h4>
        How long did it take to complete the film?
      </h4>
      <p>
        Development for the Kickstarter Fundraiser began in the summer of 2014. In February of 2015, the Kickstarter fundraiser
        launched. Filming began in 2015. The final edit of the film was completed in February of 2018.
      </p>
      <h4>
        What locations were traveled to for filming?
      </h4>
        <ul>
          <li>New York, NY</li>
          <li>Chicago, IL</li>
          <li>Los Angeles, CA</li>
          <li>Baton Rouge, LA</li>
          <li>Gruyeres & Zurich, Switzerland</li>
        </ul>
      <h4>Why is the film dedicated to H.R. Giger?</h4>
      <p>
        Ever since Borowski saw the movie Alien at the age of seven, he has always admired the amazing artwork of Giger.
        Vincent’s first gallery showing was at the Giger museum in Switzerland.
      </p>
      <h4>John Borowski is listed as producer, director, editor, and cinematographer. Did he actually fill ALL those roles?</h4>
      <p>
        Yes, John Borowski is multitalented and usually a one-man band. Realizing that his films are created on an ultra-low budget,
        Borowski fills many roles and wears many hats during the productions of his films. Borowski even designed the film’s poster!
      </p>
      <h4>How many vials of Borowski’s blood were drawn for his portrait created in his own blood?</h4>
      <p>
        Borowski gave twelve vials of his blood towards the completion of his portrait. All in one sitting!
      </p>
      <h4>Some of the footage is quite gruesome, especially the plastic surgery. Why was this footage included in graphic detail?</h4>
      <p>
        One of Vincent’s collector’s is a plastic surgeon, so Borowski intended to film him in his occupation. There are numerous
        shots of a plastic surgery included because Borowski felt the need to create an atmosphere, drawing the audience members
        into the surreal world of the film and Vincent’s paintings.
